## Commit Guidelines

- When generating commits, use the Conventional Commits spec.
- Ensure commit messages are clear and descriptive of the changes made.
- Write commit messages in the imperative mood (e.g., "fix bug" instead of "fixed bug" or "fixes bug").
- Include body text in commit messages when necessary to provide additional context.

## Tips

- Remember to update the readme or documentation if your changes affect usage or functionality.
